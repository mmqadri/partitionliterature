## About the Collection

Pakistan and Indian endured a rushed division, bringing about generations of trauma and death as communites were forced to uproot their lives when the British Empire drew a dividing line through a map. During and after the partition of the two countries, millions of people left their homes to move to the area that that was assigned to their religion, Pakistan or India. Muslims moved west to Pakistan and Hindus and Sikhs moved east to India. “The border area between India and Pakistan has been ethnically and religiously diverse for centuries, and Islamic and Hindu communities have cohabited for over 1,000 years (Riggs, 2016).” For years before colonization, religious communities across the Indian subcontinent lived among each other, everything changed when, colonization, partition, and migration took place. 

Storytelling has been a way to document and share experinces for centuries. This collection takes a look at the stories that have come out of the horrific events of partition. What was life like before, after, and during. What happened to the people that migrated, and where did they migrate to. What happened to the people that did not migrate, and why didn't they. Through these fictional stories, the authors are able to reinterpret their own experiences, as well as the experiences of their parents and grandparents who have lived through Partition.
