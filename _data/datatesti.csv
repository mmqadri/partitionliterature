coll001,,traintopakistan.jpg,Train to Pakistan,Khushwant Singh,1956,"It is a place, Khushwant Singh goes on to tell us at the beginning of this classic novel, where Sikhs and Muslims have lived together in peace for hundreds of years. Then one day, at the end of the summer, the ""ghost train"" arrives, a silent, incredible funeral train loaded with the bodies of thousands of refugees, bringing the village its first taste of the horrors of the civil war. Train to Pakistan is the story of this isolated village that is plunged into the abyss of religious hate. It is also the story of a Sikh boy and a Muslim girl whose love endures and trancends the ravages of war.",Pakistan; India; Train; Muslim; Sikh; Hindu; Muslim; dedication page;,"Monroe County Public Library, Bloomington, IN",Image;StillImage,image/jpeg

coll007,,tamas.jpg,Tamas,Bhisham Sahni,2001,"amas is a story about how simmering communal tensions snowball into full-fledged riots that grip villages across the subcontinent. In a city in undivided Punjab, Nathu, a tanner, is bribed to kill a pig. When the animal’s carcass is discovered on the steps of the local mosque the next morning, brewing tensions explode into riots and massacre. A seemingly well planned and executed job by the British plants seeds of mistrust and hatred among those who, until the day before, had been close friends and neighbours. Tamas is a chilling reminder of the consequences of religious intolerance and communal prejudice.",dedication page; punjab; muslim;,"Herman B.

Her determination to fly in the face of convention-including striking up a friendship with a transgender person-confuses her bohemian daughter, who is used to thinking of herself as the more 'modern' of the two.
