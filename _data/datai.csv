She has to give up her room and move to the attic — and worst of all, she is charged with taking care of Dadi after school. Added to her worries is the fact that Maha needs to come up with a memorable project for her media studies class —and since she is determined to be a journalist someday, she needs a truly inspiring idea. Then Dadi starts talking about her own childhood. As she begins to recount the heartbreaking events surrounding the Partition of India and her family's move to the new country of Pakistan in 1947, Maha things she has found her idea. And unexpectedly, Maha begins to understand her heritage, her family, and the sacrifices they have made.",dedication; frontise piece; map; epigraph; pakistan; india,"Monroe County Public Library, Bloomington, IN",Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,,

In a city in undivided Punjab, Nathu, a tanner, is bribed to kill a pig. When the animal’s carcass is discovered on the steps of the local mosque the next morning, brewing tensions explode into riots and massacre. A seemingly well planned and executed job by the British plants seeds of mistrust and hatred among those who, until the day before, had been close friends and neighbours. Tamas is a chilling reminder of the consequences of religious intolerance and communal prejudice.",dedication page; punjab; muslim;,"Herman B.

Her determination to fly in the face of convention-including striking up a friendship with a transgender person-confuses her bohemian daughter, who is used to thinking of herself as the more 'modern' of the two. To her family's consternation, Ma insists on travelling to Pakistan, simultaneously confronting the unresolved trauma of her teenage experiences of Partition, and re-evaluating what it means to be a mother, a daughter, a woman, a feminist",dedication page; epigraph; translated; pakistan; india,"Herman B.
